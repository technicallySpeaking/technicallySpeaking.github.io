When we're not fully billable, the team has explored a wide variety of technology. This is as good of a place as any to make note of a few.

## Voice

### Solar Pro

Illustrating the potential to create experiences as a biproduct of preexisting data, Jason built an Alexa skill that exposes energy consumption in a more human friendly way.

### Digital Shelf


## IOT

### Rosie
An arduino powered IOT device that monitors temperature and humidity in a baby's room. It makes skin care recommendations based on conditions and enables easy repurchase.


### Internet of Dingus
Ryan is in the process of building a fairly naive implementation of an IOT ecosystem to better illustrate the various bits this buzzword is comprised. You can read more about it on [this passport post](https://passport.vml.com/post/introducing-internet-dingus)

## Robots

One of the first ambitious things we made with the 3d printer was a 2 wheel robot that could be controlled via a web browser.

Ryan spent a year learning how CNC routers work via a series of experimental builds. The first iteration was to reclaim motors out of old computer parts so that a minimum viable CNC could be built for under $50.
