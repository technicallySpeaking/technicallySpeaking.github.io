When we're not fully billable, the team has explored a wide variety of technology. This is as good of a place as any to make note of a few.

## Voice

### Shopcast

Unsatisfied with perceived limitations of Google Assistant, the team worked to build out a human centered shopping experience that tied voice commands to a rich visual component. The user can have a casual conversation with Google assistant that prompts collections of products to be displayed on a near by television.

### Solar Pro

Illustrating the potential to create experiences as a byproduct of preexisting data, Jason built an Alexa skill that exposes energy consumption in a more human friendly way.

## IOT

### Digital Shelf

The team worked together to create an in-store kiosk to empower overwhelmed customers. The kiosk guides the customer to the most appropriate product by asking a series of questions. Once the perfect product has been decided upon, a series of lights guides the customer to the location of the physical product.

### Keg Stand

Jeremy has been toiling away at one of man's greatest questions... "How much beer is in the keg?" Keg Stand is an awesome Arduino based monitoring system. When a new keg is tapped, you let the system know what it's called. The Untapped API then provides information about the beer of the week. Historically, a flow meter has monitored consumption and gave real-time status on the contents of the keg. Currently, Jeremy (unsatisfied with the quality of the data from the flow meter) has been working on updating the system to use weight based metrics instead.

Anyone pouring a beer at the kegerator will see what's on tap and how much of it is left...

Data dumps happen every 10 seconds from the app so that other services (Alexa, for instance) can pull from that data.

### Rosie

An Arduino powered IOT device that monitors temperature and humidity in a baby's room. It makes skin care recommendations based on conditions and enables easy repurchase.

### Internet of Dingus

Ryan is in the process of building a fairly naive implementation of an IOT ecosystem to better illustrate the various bits this buzzword is comprised. You can read more about it on [this passport post](https://passport.vml.com/post/introducing-internet-dingus).

## Robots

One of the first ambitious things we made with the 3d printer was a 2 wheel robot that could be controlled via a web browser.

Ryan spent a year learning how CNC routers work via a series of experimental builds. The first iteration was to reclaim motors out of old computer parts so that a minimum viable CNC could be built for under $50.

This minor vicory was rolled into spending more money on motors and building a more advanced CNC router based on open source hardware.
