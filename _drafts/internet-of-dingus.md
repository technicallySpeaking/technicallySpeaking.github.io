In this monthâ€™s Technically Speaking, Ryan demystifies the internet of things by creating an example to illustrate all the parts that make it work.

## What's a dingus?
A dingus is... a kind of a thing. For the purposes of this talk, a dingus has:

1. Wifi
2. One actuator
3. One sensor

I happened to make my first one from a Huzzah Feather from a company called Adafruit. It's compatible with Arduino, but has wifi built in.

## What's an Internet of Dingus?

1. One or more dingus
2. An MQTT broker (I used Adafruit.io)
3. A Drupal instance for registering a dingus and handling user auth
4. A decoupled frontend to tie the experience together (I opted to use Vue for this)
